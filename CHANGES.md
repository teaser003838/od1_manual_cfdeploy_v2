## Technical Details

### Video Quality Implementation
The quality selection works by:
1. Adding a quality parameter to the streaming URL
2. Backend recognizes the quality parameter and adjusts streaming accordingly
3. Frontend preserves playback state when switching qualities
4. Automatic fallback to 'Auto' quality if specific quality fails

### Large File Optimization
For files over 1GB:
- Chunk size increased to 2MB (from 1MB)
- Timeout extended to 300 seconds (from 60 seconds)
- Range requests limited to prevent memory issues
- Adaptive caching strategies implemented

### Controls Auto-Hide Logic
- Controls start hidden by default
- Show on video load, pause, end, or any mouse/touch interaction
- Auto-hide after 5 seconds of inactivity during playback
- Menu interactions lock controls visible until menu closes
- Consistent behavior in both windowed and fullscreen modes
- Enhanced CSS with both opacity and visibility transitions

## Files Modified Summary
1. `/app/frontend/public/index.html` - Removed Emergent branding
2. `/app/frontend/src/VideoPlayer.js` - Enhanced video player functionality
3. `/app/frontend/src/VideoPlayer.css` - Improved control styling and visibility
4. `/app/backend/server.py` - Enhanced streaming with quality support and large file optimization
5. `/app/frontend/src/FileExplorer.js` - ~~Enhanced folder statistics~~ (reverted)
6. `/app/frontend/src/FileExplorer.css` - ~~Folder statistics styling~~ (reverted)

## Performance Improvements
- **Removed**: Folder statistics calculation that was causing slow loading times
- **Optimized**: Large file streaming for better performance
- **Enhanced**: Control visibility with proper CSS transitions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test video quality switching with various file formats
2. Verify controls auto-hide behavior in both windowed and fullscreen modes
3. Test large file streaming (>1GB) with MKV format
4. Test seekbar accuracy during playback
5. Confirm removal of Emergent branding in production build
6. Verify controls are hidden by default and only show on interaction

## User Experience Focus
- **Quality Selection**: Working quality selector with 480p, 720p, 1080p, and Auto options
- **Control Visibility**: Controls hidden by default, show on interaction, auto-hide after 5 seconds
- **Performance**: Fast loading without slow folder statistics calculations
- **Large Files**: Optimized streaming for files over 1GB (especially MKV format)

## Future Enhancements
