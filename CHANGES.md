## Technical Details

### Video Quality Implementation
The quality selection works by:
1. Adding a quality parameter to the streaming URL
2. Backend recognizes the quality parameter and adjusts streaming accordingly
3. Frontend preserves playback state when switching qualities
4. Automatic fallback to 'Auto' quality if specific quality fails

### Large File Optimization
For files over 1GB:
- Chunk size increased to 2MB (from 1MB)
- Timeout extended to 300 seconds (from 60 seconds)
- Range requests limited to prevent memory issues
- Adaptive caching strategies implemented

### Controls Auto-Hide Logic
- Controls start hidden by default
- Show on any mouse movement or touch
- Auto-hide after 5 seconds of inactivity
- Menu interactions lock controls visible until menu closes
- Consistent behavior in both windowed and fullscreen modes

## Files Modified Summary

2. `/app/frontend/src/VideoPlayer.js` - Enhanced video player functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test video quality switching with various file formats
2. Verify controls auto-hide behavior in both windowed and fullscreen modes
3. Test large file streaming (>1GB) with MKV format
4. Verify folder statistics accuracy across different folder structures
5. Test seekbar accuracy during playback
